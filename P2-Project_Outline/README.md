## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I volunteer with an animal shelter, and one of the things I hear the most from the admin staff is how complicated and unnecessary many of the features in current shelter tracking software are. I would like to build simple, easy to use software, that is tailored to a foster-based shelter organization.  

### Features
information storage and tracking of pets, and people.
ability to match pets and foster/adoption families more easily.
web based so that admins can access information from anywhere. (login, different roles, ect.)

### Technologies
Java, gradle, spring, thymeleaf, sql?

### What I'll Have to Learn
how to search across multiple databases.
bootstrap and css to add polish.
an API to connect to national database of adoptable dogs?
